# Chemmantatta Story - GitHub Pages Publishing Guide

## Repository Analysis Summary

### Issues Found:
1. **ZIP File Present**: The repository contains `html5.zip` (2.98 MB) which should be extracted for proper web hosting
2. **Missing index.html**: GitHub Pages looks for `index.html` by default, but the main file is `story.html`
3. **Storyline 360 Course**: This is an e-learning course created with Articulate Storyline 360

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Main HTML File Identified**: `story.html` serves as the primary entry point
2. **File Structure**: Individual files are already extracted alongside the ZIP file
3. **Publishing Instructions**: Step-by-step guide provided below

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/radhikasuresh12/chemmantatta-story`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Choose **main** branch and **/ (root)** folder
6. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Access Your Published Site
After enabling GitHub Pages, your site will be available at:
```
https://radhikasuresh12.github.io/chemmantatta-story/story.html
```

### Step 3: Create an Index File (Recommended)
To make the site accessible without specifying the filename:

1. Create a new file called `index.html` in the root directory
2. Add this content to redirect to the main story:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Chemmantatta Story</title>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=story.html">
</head>
<body>
    <p>Redirecting to <a href="story.html">Chemmantatta Story</a>...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab to monitor deployment progress
2. Wait for the green checkmark indicating successful deployment
3. Visit your site URL to test functionality

## File Structure Overview

- `story.html` - Main Storyline 360 course file
- `html5/` - Course assets and libraries
- `story_content/` - Course content files
- `mobile/` - Mobile-specific assets
- `analytics-frame.html` - Analytics tracking
- `meta.xml` - Course metadata
- `html5.zip` - Compressed version (can be removed after extraction)

## Recommendations

1. **Remove ZIP File**: Consider deleting `html5.zip` as the files are already extracted
2. **Add Index File**: Create `index.html` for easier access (see Step 3 above)
3. **Custom Domain**: Optionally configure a custom domain in Pages settings
4. **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS for `.github.io` domains

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: Ensure GitHub Pages is enabled and files are in the main branch
- **Course Not Loading**: Check browser console for errors; some features may require HTTPS
- **Mobile Issues**: The course includes mobile-specific assets for responsive design
